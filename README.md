# leftover_saver
Leftover Saver! will help you prevent food waste by allowing you to log when you created that last culinary masterpiece that you were unable to finish. After registering you can enter any food item with the preparation date into the Save A Leftover view as you enter it into the refrigerator. Later simply log in and View Your Leftovers to get a list of all your logged leftovers.

I created Leftover Saver! as my solo project while attending Prime Digital Academy. I've deployed Leftover Saver! on Heroku. You can find it at leftover-saver.herokuapp.com
